(C) Rod Toll 2015-2017, Licensed under the MIT-LICENSE.
Continued development by shbatm, 2017-

Javascript library for interfacing with the ISY-99i from Universal Devices. (http://www.universal-devices.com).

Getting Started
---------------

First, clone the repository:

```
1. $ git clone https://github.com/rodtoll/isy-js.git
2. $ cd isy-js
3. $ npm install
```

Testing
-------

If you wish to test the library against a simulator I recommend fake-isy-994i project. (Full disclosure, I use it to test this library). For more details see https://github.com/rodtoll/fake-isy-994i/.

There is a mocha based set of tests in the tests directory now. Install and run the fake-isy-994i project in the background and then you can use npm test from the root directory of your enlistment to check for issues. 

Travis CI is used for CI. You can see the .travis.yml to see the config used to run the tests.

Features
--------

* Enumeration of devices along with basic metadata.
* Basic commands for several device types.
* Automatic updating of current state of devices while operating.
* Change notifications when device state changes.
* Support for elk connected alarm.
* Support for elk sensors. 
* Support for scenes
* Support for generic devices through ISYBaseDevice
* Support for variables (thanks @bdstark)
* Support for Node Servers

Setup
-----

First create an instance of the ISY root object:

```
var ISY = require('isy-js');

var isy = new ISY.ISY('<ADDRESS>', '<AdminUserName>', '<PAssword>', changeCallback, useHttps, scenesInDeviceList, enableDebugLog, variableChangeCallback);
```

Next, initialize the device list and start the websocket listening for updates:

```
isy.initialize(handleInitialized);
```

The callback, handleInitialized, takes no parameters and is called when the entire device list has been enumerated. Once this callback is called then the object is safe to use.

You can then retrieve a list of devices, and operate on them, by calling isy.getDeviceList(). You can then operate on the device objects through their properties and functions.

DEBUG MESSAGES
--------------
You can get debug messages to the console by specifying true for the enableDebugLog parameter in the constructor. Debug logs will
be written to the console.

Alternatively you can set the environment variable ISYJSDEBUG to a value to have the same effect.

DEVICE TYPES
------------

### Specific Support

For devices which are supported specifically a class is available which is specific to that type. To support a device specifically it needs to be defined in the isydevicetypes.json file
or be appropriately identified with the ISY device class information. If you would like a device to be identified specifically then request it be added to isydevicetypes.json or file a
bug against the project with device information so the ISY device class algorithm can be updated.

For these devices a ISYXXXXDevice object will be available.

### Generic Support

For devices which are not specifically supported through the isydevicetypes.json file or the ISY device class information a ISYBaseDevice object will be available. It contains all
support operations that this library supports. It *does not* prevent you from making a command call against a device that makes no sense. For example you could get the current
lighting status on a device which isn't a light. The results should not be harmful but likely don't make sense.

But if you know what a device is then you can use those functions to send the right commands.

DESIGN
------

The ISY object enumerates devices. The set of ISYXXXDevice and ELkXXXX hide all the complexity of sending commands and transating updates into state for callers. The ISY object uses WebSockets to get live updates. Events are raised when state changes (once enumeration is done).

API - SPECIFIC DEVICES
----------------------

### ISY

Properties:
* `address` - Address of the ISY.

Functions:
* `new ISY(address, username, password, elkEnabled, changeCallback, useHttps,scenesInDeviceList,enableDebugLog,variableCallback)` - Creates a new instance. address indicates the ip address of your
isy, username the username for the admin user and password the password for the admin user, elkEnabled indicates if an elk
alarm system is connected or not (boolean) and changeCallback is called when the property of a device changes. Takes two
parameters the pointer to the ISY object and the device. The useHttps parameter is optional and if specified and set to true will have the library use https to talk to isy.
It uses http by default. The next parameter scenesInDeviceList specifies if scenes should be included in the list of devices.
This defaults to false. The next parameter enableDebugLog, which is optional, specifies if debug log should be dumped to the
console during execution. Useful for debugging problems. The final parameter is the callback function which should be called when a variable value changes.
* `initialize(handleInitialized)` - Connects to the isy, retrieves the list of devices, updates their status and starts the websocket callbacks for updating the local objects.
* `getDeviceList()` - Gets the array of devices, each represented as an ISYDevice object.
* `getDevice(address)` - Gets the device identified by the specified isy address.
* `getSceneList()` - Gets the array of scenes, each represented as an ISYScene object.
* `getScene(address)` - Gets the scene identified by the specified isy address.
* `getElkAlarmPanel()` - Returns a device representing the elk alarm panel
* `getVariableList()` - Returns a list of ISYVariable objects, one for each variable the ISY supports.
* `getVariable(type,id)` - Returns the ISYVariable object representing the ISY variable of the specified type and id. null if not found.

### Notifications - Devices/Scenes

The function `changeCallback` specified in the constructor will be called when a device state changes. It will also be
called when a scene changes as a result of a device changing. Note that if a scene is changed then each individual
device in the scene will end up getting change notifications. Also note that for each device change in a scene an
individual change notification is raised for the scene - so you can track the changes as each device is changed.

Function should be of the form:
* `changeCallback(isy,device)` - Isy is the isy instance the notification is from and device is the device which changed.

### Notifications - Variables

If a variable changes value then the `variableCallback` specified in the constructor will be called.

Function should be of the form:
* `variableCallback(isy,variable)` - Isy is the isy instance the notification is from and the variable is the variable which changed.

### All Devices/Scenes

Properties:
* `isy` - Gets the isy instance this device is from.
* `name` - Name for the device.
* `address` - ISY address for the device.
* `isyType` - ISY type identifier for the device. see isydevicetypes.json for the map from isy types to friendly device names.
* `deviceFriendlyName` - Friendly name for the type of device.
* `deviceType` - Type of device. See `isydefs.json` > `deviceType` for possible values.
* `connectionType` - Type of connection to the Insteon network. Possible values - "Insteon Wired", "Insteon Wireless", "Insteon MorningLinc", "ZWave". See isydevicetypes.json for the map.
* `batteryOperated` - true if this is a battery powered device, false otherwise.
* `lastChanged` - Date/time the last time this library saw that the device characteristics have changed.

The sendXXXCommand are functions which tell the device to move the specified state. The local device will not update it's state until the ISY has acknowledged the change. To get the last acknowledged state call the getXXXXState commands.

The resultCallback parameter specifies a required callback that will specify true if the command succeeded, false otherwise.

on success, false on failure when the call is complete. The local value will be updated when a notification is received.

API - GENERIC DEVICES
---------------------

### ISYBaseDevice

For devices which are not specifically supported the following generic object can be used to interact with the device.
The operations you can use may or may not make sense for the given device. It is recommended that you only use the
operations which you know what the type of device is but the library doesn't. By it's nature these operations have not
been tested.

Functions:

All of the device specific operations offered by the specific device types are supported on these objects. See the
documentation for each of the specific device types ISYXXXDevice. Beyond those the following operations are supported:
* `getCurrentNonSecureLockState()` - Gets the current locked state of the Insteon lock device. true for locked, false for unlocked.
* `sendNonSecureLockCommand(state,resultCallback(success))` - Sends the command to set the Insteon Lock state to the specified state. true to lock the door, false to unlock it.
* `getCurrentSecureLockState()` - Gets the current locked state of the secure lock device (usually zwave locks). true for locked, false for unlocked.
* `sendSecureLockCommand(state,resultCallback(success))` - Sends the command to set the lock device (usually zwave locks) lock state to the specified state. true to lock the door, false to unlock it.

API - NODE SERVER DEVICES
-------------------------

### ISYNodeServerNode

Added in v0.6.0 to support ISYv5+ node servers. For node server device nodes, a generic object will be built during initialization. After initial loading, the ISY will send a status update for node server nodes and additional properties will be populated. For "Generic Value" changes (e.g. GV11), if a formatted value and name is returned, it will be added to the device object.  For example, the ISY Data Node Server returns the current year as GV9, you can access this via device.GV9 = 2018, or device.Year = "2018". From your program call `device.getFormattedStatus()` to return a JSON dump of all of a node server device's properties.

CHANGELOG
---------

* 0.6.2 - 2018/04/26 - Further linting and migration to JavaScript. Include formatted status/property values from ISY as `ISYDevice.currentState_f` (or `ISYDevice.propName_f`).
* 0.6.1 - 2018/04/24 - Offloaded all constants (except Elk) to `isydefs.json` file. Available in code by using `ISYDefs` object or with a reference to the ISY object using `isy.defs` object.
* 0.6.0 - 2018/04/23 - Update to use XML2JS to parse XML responses into native JS objects. Added support for Node Server nodes and advanced properties.
* 0.5.0 - 2017/10/25 - Limited support resumed. Changes from shbatm/isy-js and tenstartups/isy-js have been incorportated. Changes include: removal of guardian timer, limited support for programs (executing), read-only support for Insteon Thermostats, bug fixes to support ISY v5 Firmware and Node Servers.
* 0.4.5 - 2017/07/04 - Support suspended. Active development ended. 
* 0.4.4 - 2017/01/14 - Restored chatty scene notifications, logic to quiet them wasn't right. Better chatty and correct then wrong and less chatty.

TODO
----

* Additional support for programs.
* Better error checking.
* The ISY-994 will sometimes return incomplete XML (missing part of the closing tag) and we should be resilient to that.
* ELk > 1 areas

## From original author: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT & SUPPORT DISCONTINUED
I am sad to announce that I am discontinuing support for this library. This means I will no longer be addressing any open bugs, responding to feature requests or 
releasing new versions. Between work and my home life there simply isn't the time. I will leave the repository online and the 
package on npm but that is it. As this code is licensed under the MIT license you are of course welcome to branch this code and make it your own and use it in your 
own projects -- but you do so, as always, with no warranty or support from me. 

I want to thank everyone who helped along the way through questions and issues and code contributions -- your assistance was very much appreciated. And it made the 
late nights and testing worth it. 

If you find a good alternative and want others to know about it then open a new issue and provide a pointer. I might post a link here.

## From Contributor SHBATM:
I will provide limited continued development of this module. Please direct any pull requests to the shbatm/isy-js fork for now to include any changes.
